# go-github-users
Practice and learn go basics while creating an API

## About
The intention behind creating this repo is to create a Go application that will use the Github users API to have endpoints for:
 - Read information from CSV file and display it as JSON
 - Read information from Github users API and write it to a CSV file
 - Filtering information by some criteria

It will use the clean architechture, conventions, best practices and unit testing.
